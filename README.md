# School-data-generative-alagorithm-with-python
The base code for this project was generated using chat GPT. I then updated and optimised it to the way I wanted.
This algorithm can generate up to 50,000 unique entries of student data. The total data field being generated per student is 11 which include
Student ID, Student Name, DOB, Age, Place of Birth, Father's Name, Father's Occupation, Gender, Class, Tuition Due, Tuition Paid.
The output file is a CSV file and it is saved locally.
To open and compile this file, you need an IDE like Visual Studio Code. The algorithm is written in Python.

This algorithm's main purpose is to generate data for data analysis, but it can also be used for non-fraudulent and educative purposes.
