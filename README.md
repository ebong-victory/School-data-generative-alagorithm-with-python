# School-data-generative-alagorithm-with-python
The base code for this project was generated using chat gpt. I then updated and optimised it to the way I wanted.
This algorithm can generate up to 50,000 unique entries of student data. The total data field bein generated per student is 11 which include
Student ID,Student Name,DOB,Age,Place of Birth,Father's Name,Father's Occupation,Gender,Class,Tuition Due,Tuition Paid.
The output file is a csv file and it is saved locally.
You need an IDE like Visual Studio Code to open and compile this file. Th algorithm is written in python.
